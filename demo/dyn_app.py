"This sample application demonstrates dynamic class loading with configmanners."
# there are two ways to invoke this app:
#    .../generic_app.py --admin.application=dyn_app.Dyn_app
#    .../dyn_app.py

# this app simulates passing a group of records from one datasource to
# another.  It offers fake versions of Postgres, MySQL and HBase as the
# data sources and sinks.

    # the command line or config file.

    # for the destination.  We use separate namespaces to avoid name
    # collisions.  For example, both the source and destination are going
    # to have 'hostname' and we don't want to mix them up.

    # configuration parameters gleaned from the loaded class itself.
